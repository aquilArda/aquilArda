# Hi ðŸ‘‹
# I'm Arda, a 16-year-old front-end web developer from Turkey. My passion for coding goes hand in hand with my strong advocacy for free and open-source software. Currently, I'm using macOS but Fedora Linux has a special place in my heart.

# Being part of Team Voltran for Teknofest and First Lego League at my school brings out the team player in me. I thrive on collaboration and love being in the thick of it, trying to contribute my skills to the success of the team.

# I have a diverse range of interests, including strategy games, classical music, coding, and Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS).
